## Summary
Des Moines is a great city to start a bikesharing business. Male subscribers are the most popular user, and subscribers are more popular users than customers. This indicates that while tourists use the bikesharing program, they are not depended on to provide for the success of the business. Two additional visualizations that should be added are commuting routes for Des Moines and a closer look at the starting locations of the New York City bikesharing data. A visualization should be created that shows the users compared to the starting and ending points of the data. This will show if the popularity in Manhattan is due to tourists or commuters.
